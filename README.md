# ImageToASCII
This is a program to convert Images to ASCII art
# Usage
This program is used by inputting parameters into command line. First you have to go the directory of the main.py file by typing 
```
cd [FILEPATH]
```
Then write
```
python3 main.py "[INPUTIMAGEPATH]" "[OUTPUTFOLDER]" [COMPRESSIONRATE]
```
# Parameters
[INPUTIMAGEPATH] and [OUTPUTFOLDER] are self-explanatory, [COMPRESSIONRATE] dictates how smaller the output ASCII art will be in comparisson to input image. I has to be an integer. For example, setting it to 2 will make the output twice as small as the input.
